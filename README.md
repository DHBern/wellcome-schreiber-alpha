# wellcome-schreiber-alpha

*Digitalfaksimiles der bislang bekannten und in öffentlichen Bibliotheken zugänglichen Handschriften des sog. ‚Wellcome-Schreibers‘ (Thüringen, ca. 1440–1470). Eingerichtet von Prof. Dr. Michael Stolz (Universität Bern), 2024, Archiv-Version.*

### Technical note:

After initial release, this repository served the following purpose:

> This is an auxiliary repository to provide access to the (currently private) data of the `wellcome-schreiber` repository.
> 
> It makes use of a narrowly-scoped access token to fetch the head ref of the main branch and to publish it as a Github Page (with access to certain paths requiring an access code).
> 
> Once `wellcome-schreiber` is ready for open publication, this repository/deployment workflow will be deactivated and replaced by a simple GH Pages workflow directly in the `wellcome-schreiber` repo.

On 2025-01-25 the setup was altered to redirect to the now publicly available https://dhbern.github.io/wellcome-schreiber.
